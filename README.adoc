= PoC: Spring Boot LiveReload

Existing support for https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/using/devtools.html#using.devtools.livereload[LiveReload in Spring Boot] depends on LiveReload browser extensions.
There are several concerns related to that approach:

- LiveReload browser extensions https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/livereload-web-extension/[&#91;1&#93;] https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei[&#91;2&#93;] have been unmaintained for several years
- modern web development tools offer LiveReload (or similar) capabilities without needing to use any browser extensions

This project is a proof of concept for an improved LiveReload support in Spring Boot that doesn't require usage of browser extensions.
The approach taken in this PoC consists of:

- https://github.com/livereload/livereload-js[LiveReload.js] script served as a static resource
- a Servlet filter (see link:poc-devtools/src/main/java/poc/devtools/LiveReloadScriptInjectingFilter.java[`LiveReloadScriptInjectingFilter`]) that injects LiveReload.js script element into the head of an HTML document being served
- auto-configuration (see link:poc-devtools/src/main/java/poc/devtools/LiveReloadScriptInjectingFilterAutoConfiguration.java[`LiveReloadScriptInjectingFilterAutoConfiguration`]) that sets up the filter if DevTools are enabled

All of the above are handled by `poc-devtools`, which depends on `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-devtools` and pulls it in transitively, while `poc-application` is a simple Spring Boot application that utilizes the `poc-devtools` and can be used to showcase the improved LiveReload capabilities.

NOTE: This PoC targets Servlet-stack (Spring Web MVC)
